## 2.2.4 Exercises

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

I see empty.

2. How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?

```{r}
nrow(mpg)
```

There are 234 rows.

3. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.

```{r}
?mpg
```

dv means:

> "the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd"


4. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+
geom_point(aes(hwy,cyl))
```


5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+
geom_point(aes(class,drv))
```
